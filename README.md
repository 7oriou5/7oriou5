- Hi, I’m @7oriou5
- I’m interested in people watching, hoarding sneakers and all dogs ever.
- I’m currently learning css and Javascript to start (no coding experience full stop) then onto Python and I find C interesting. Its early days.
- Got html down pretty quickly thanks to MySpace circa 2004.
- I’m aiming to create websites for my side hustles, and eventually get my app idea down.
- I don't like emojis.
